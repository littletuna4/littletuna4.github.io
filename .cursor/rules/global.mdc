Stack and tool preference:
Use pnpm
Use powershell syntax for cli commands

Use npx
Site is to be fully static - use no server side etc.
Use lucide for icons (not emojis)

Assume existing code is wrong or overly complex.


DIFFS:
K.I.S.S.
Never add features (regardless of how small) without being requested.
Write Production ready code & comments - focussing on best practice.

Make everything responsive

DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
Maintain a list of functional requirements at the top of each component. These should be updated any time a file is touched.
Do not add comments describing changes - comments are for documenting what is going on and notes useful for visiting developers.

Maintain and update the /docs folder agressively & proactively.

Seek out and proactively resolve inconsistencies, unused/excessive code, decomposition opportunities.

Do not remove comments.

Fully type. Never use "any".

Never patch - always fix properly.


Use _excessively_ long file/function/variable names suitable for a large repo.

Report your adherance to each of these points.


Use the THEME_SYSTEM.md
