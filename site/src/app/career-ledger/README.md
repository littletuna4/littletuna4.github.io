# Career Ledger

Welcome to the Career Ledger, a structured and extensible markdown-based record of my professional journey, projects, and achievements. This repository is designed to be both human-readable but mostly ai-indexable, supporting comprehensive documentation while remaining neatly organized.

This ideas has somewhat evolved into my pkm setup.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive, version-controlled log of:

* Roles and responsibilities at various employers
* Projects I've led or contributed to
* Technical and non-technical achievements
* Skills applied and developed over time
* Learnings, reflections, and milestones

It aims to function as:

* A **living resume**
* A **career journal**
* A **portfolio backend**
* A **searchable, indexable archive** of professional work

## Repository Structure

The Career Ledger is organized into the following main sections:
