## Content Guidelines

### General Guidelines

- Each entry should be comprehensive and self-contained while referencing related content
- The tone should be very dry, technical, short in style, long in content. All implicit information and common knowledge should be avoided. Be robotically informative.
- Use markdown formatting consistently across all documents
- Include dates, durations, and specific contexts where applicable
- Make liberal use of internal cross-linking between related documents
- Link to external resources when appropriate (portfolios, GitHub repos, publications, etc.)
- Ensure all content is professional and appropriately detailed
- Files and folders should all be in snake-case

### Resume JSON
Resumes should be stylistically tailored for recruiters.
Resumes should seek to find the intersection of recorded experience and the job requirements, but never imagine a item.

resume.json should strictly adhere to this example schema. Only use the available fields
 ```json
