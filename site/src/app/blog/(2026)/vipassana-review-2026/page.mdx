# Vipassana Review 2026

I've just returned from a 10 day Vipassana meditation retreat at [Dhamma Rasmi](https://rasmi.dhamma.org/).  

## My Prep

- No Expectations or meditation routine

## The Course

### The Practice

Strikingly simple

- Anapana Meditation - Focus on the breath.
- Vipassana Meditation - Focus on body sensations.

### The Philosophy/values and concepts

- Sila: Morality
- Samadhi: Focus
- Panna: Wisdom
    - Wisdom
- Metta: Love
- Dhamma: Truth
- Anicca: Impermanence
- Dukkha: Suffering
- Five Parts of self:
    - Body
    - Mind
        - Cognizing
        - Recognizing
        - Feeling
        - Acting

### The facilities

- Wonderful.

### Aesthetic

- Pali chanting challenging/distracting; particularly initially.
- Clearly emergent from a hyperspiritual, polytheistic culture. I was expecting this to be unpalatable. But it was actually quite self aware, unapologetic, and unforceful/preachey.

### Take what works for you

- This was really emphasised.
- Students were encouraged to be cynical and take away only what works for them.
- Everyone really appreciates this.

### Nightly Discourses.

Sermons & Metaphors:

## My Experience

### Memory Palace
- Based on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)
- Built around my parents garage. Meritable becuse I know it well; and it has lots of nooks and crannies to fill.

 - **Mum's car/Driver's seat:**
    - I don't know why, but I got the word "phylactory" stuck in my head. And I couldn't ask google, chatgpt, or any people what it meant.
    - Phi Symbol, Lactacting, on the cover of a story book
    - Someone also had a pair of sandals that looked like burkenstock. The brand was "Neckermann" and I wanted to research them. So the phi eventually had a sandal for a necklace charm.
 - **Mum's car/Passenger seat:**
    - A hundred plates stacked on top of each other.
    - The food on top was saurkraut sandwhiches on sourdough. With a glass of kombucha and some yoghurnt.
    - Symbolising
 - **Mum's Car/Back left seat:**
    - Symbol of "the system"'s features (and a few tasks):
    - System should indicate progress to a goal or set of goals: a lego bar in a lego frame - each block representing a task or acheivement
    - System should have flexibily: some of the blocks are rubbery.
    - System should have breaks built in: gaps in the lego blocks
    - System should train operator in "grit": sandpaper on the seat the structure is sitting on.
    - System should refine itself: surface is polished smooth. Polished grit on the left side of the sandpaper on the seat back rest. It should have regular structured time for review of itself and priorities/tasks
    - System should have a feedback loop: the bar is actually in a loop behind the frame.
    - System should have time for writing: Permanent marker on the progress frame.
    - I need to get a skin check/system should factor in health related tasks: a bloodied gorey mole scraped off on the sandpaper half.
 - **Mum's Car/Back middle seat:**
    - "Building in the open"
 - **East window sill:**
    - A musical mobile with an ear, a moon, and the horrible clicking song.
        - Symbolic of my health and ear; kind of wonky and distressingly assymetrical at times.
        - Symbolic of the realisiation I'm definitely a night person.
        - Symbolic of "wow my joints click alot when I move."
 - **Fingernail trail to the fish pond**
    - A reminder of how I laughed to myself 

### Projects

I'm a little addicted to starting projects. Wish I could execute on them better. The ones I can remember becaming fixated on were:

- Watch repair - simple. Mechanical little intersting thing to do.
- B&T Digital Contracts
    - OnSpec Instrument platform
    - Automated quoting system and parametrised cad drawig generation tool for LaserIt in gladstone. Who've I've had experience with as a customer; and know their system could be streamlined on at least one dimension.
- 100 Dinner Parties.
    - I'd like to spin up a practice were twice a week, I host a casual little potluck. Make it a routine/systemised habit. And connect regularly with weak connections
    - I'd like to fund this with the sale of my watch into a fund.
- 'The System'
    - I'd like to develop a self improving self improvement system/routine.
- 'Fermentation & Farm'
    - I'd like to make some kombucha; and was thinking about how I could industrialise it in my garage.
    - I'd like to make some big batches of saurkraut.
    - I'd like to get into making sourdough.
    - I'd like to a hydroponic or aeroponic cappage or cotton greenhouse set up in the back pad of sundridge street. For either 
- Aquaculture - e.g. spirulina in the back yard.
- Cotton Mill
- Waste to cellulose/textile.
    - A backyard bio-process project to convert foodwaste (or other waste) into cellulose/lyocell/similar; and then make fabric from it.
    - Super wierd timinging due the release of a video from 'the thought emporium' on ethanol to paper processing. While I was away - basically the same idea.
- Nitrate production:
    - Similar aquaculture - thing maybe
    - Phosphate and/or nitrate extraction from human waste instead of dilution into sea water. This has to get economic at some point when the phosphorous gets scarce.
- Rust based pkm application with heavy indexation
    - I want to develop a better version of logseq 
        - Opensource.
        - Highly highly performant/scalable.
        - Symplified syntax.
            - All configuration in the file and cascaded configureatio with a file based scope system. (Sort of like file based routing/layout application in next.js, but for config)
        - First class support for calendar events, tasks, time, and project managmenet. Via classing/templating and proactive indexing on these bases.
    - I was thinking about:
        - ai features.
            - Tracking the user's tabs and access path. Constructing a train of thought with weights and a markov model/table to inform importance of context and relationships.
        - Graph features.
            - Filtering based on index, locality and modeling.
        - Efficient Indexation features.
        - Publishing features:
            - An optional server and auth system for public internet access. Maybe collaboration - although I've not thought of an elegant path there to distribute ownership of a network.
        - Plugin formfactor:
            - How to radically simplify installation of plugins as files in the application. Managing trust and ease of use.
- Thought lots about writing and setting up a print on demand recipe book from the recipes. They were so good.

### Interesting Experiences

- Flowers
- Leach, tick
- Showers/floss
- Kangaroos.
- Walks
- Fish
    - Laughing to my self at the thought of a set of instructions closing with 'I don't know why we have to keep saying this, but, for the love of god, don't feed the fish fingernails.'
- Missing sermon - 
- Shared
