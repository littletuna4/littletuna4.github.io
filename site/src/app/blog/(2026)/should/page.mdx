I think that the english language and our perhaps our culture has a "should" problem.
## The implicit if.

Making a should statement always has a implicit `value-statement` **or** `perspective` attached. In a world where shared values are not guarantees (although their commonality is frequently understated). I think that is important to consider.

All should statements can be be represented as follows:

> X should Y (if Z)

If the `if Z` statement is omitted or simplified, than whoever is making the statement is taking it to be self-evident or implicit through context or shared experience.

Convenient and appropriate as this may be, it poses a large hole for misunderstanding and frustration, with some misunderstandings being more common than others.

## t-Should vs b-Should

I think there is a common scenario where two individuals take different perspectives to a should statement, and falsely interpret the other as having incompatible or unreasonable values, when in reality, it's a framing issue.

Specifically, I see a bottom-up perspective that emphasises personal responsibility in the face of reality; and another top-down perspective that emphasises the moral systematic issues of virtue and culture. I think a lot of discussions and arguments would be served by clarifying the should.

Consider the statement (suspending your own position for a moment):
"Women should expect harassment if they wear makeup in the workplace"

<ExpandableSection summary="Aside / footnote (expand for clarifications)">
  <p>If it's not eminently clear, I am trying to make a semantic/lexical point here. I don't really have strong positions on gender-politics. It's a punchy, illustrative & convenient example.</p>
  <p>Aside from there perspective issue, there is also the question of the frequency, intensity and mode of harassment to expect; which is not described in the statement, and another potential axis for perceived misalignment despite a possible common truth.</p>
  <p>If you're really interested in some I think on this. I'd advocate that individuals mostly-silently normalise what they deem to be reasonable self-expression, accepting the level of risk they deem reasonable and present.</p>
  <p>I think that our culture is, to some extent engineered but the influence an individual has over it is either negligible or finite for most people.</p>
  <p>I think both positions are perfectly reasonable to take, and that it's unreasonable to expect or demand that an individual makes your group-identity issue theirs.</p>
  <p>I think clanning and group-identity is often useful, and should be done deliberately along meaningful axes; but, clinging to a group-identity on the basis of bodily similarity is usually kind of lame.</p>

## Conclusion

I don't condemn the use of should statements; neither do I prescribe lengthy contextual exposition of context in the everyday use of should statements. I do think that there is space and need to offer some clarifying positional information under some circumstances; particularly along the group/individual axis that I have discussed.
