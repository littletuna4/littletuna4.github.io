This blog's an excerise in imperfection.

A place for attempts at articulating half baked ideas and whispy trains of though.

A practice in ordering thoughts and maybe routine.

I'd liken my head to a loose bundle of long and whispy cotton threads thrown in a box and tossed around. I want to practice making rope, or maybe a shirt (probably a Hawaiian one)

For now, its not a place for relentless optimisation or even necessarily valuable insight.
